# Hi there 👋

I am a full stack freelance web developer with many years of experience working on various projects. My main focus is web development (both front-end and back-end) but I also do mobile development using React Native. 

I like working in a team and am always ready to learn something new. I am very persistent in what I do and pay veeery close attention to details. My main technology stack includes JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, AWS, Express.js, React/Next.js and MongoDB.
