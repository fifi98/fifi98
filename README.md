# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack web developer with many years of experience working on various projects. My main focus is web development (both front-end and back-end) but I also do mobile development using React Native. 

I am very persistent in what I do and pay very close attention to details. I am flexible with working hours and maintain good communication with my clients. I am interested in both short and long term projects. Click on the repositories tab to see my portfolio.
